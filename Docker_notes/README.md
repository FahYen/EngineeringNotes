# Docker Cheat Sheet
Docker is similar to git in a way that you can push a record of your code to an remote database and it can be pulled by other computers. The main difference is that the docker image includes the environment and compiled libraries/packages that the project depends on, while git only contains the source code of your project. The purpose of this is such that when you push an image to a registry, and another computer pulls the image and runs the image, the version of operating system and packages will be exactly the same, so you save the pain of solving dependency issues.
